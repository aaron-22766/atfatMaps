atfatMaps (And Thanks For All The Maps) is a program that
handles and generates maps for the so_long project.

Optional flags:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  If present, verbose mode will print the map,
                 its source and its specs

Read map from existing file:
  [file]         Path to an already existing map file.
                 If present, the use of any of the
                 generation flags below is prohibited.

Generate new map with any combination of these optional flags:
  -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH
                 If present, this argument sets the width for the generated map
                 (3 - 255) && (width * height > 14)
  -h HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT
                 If present, this argument sets the height for the generated map
                 (3 - 255) && (width * height > 14)
  -c COLLECTIBLES, --collectibles COLLECTIBLES
                 If present, this argument sets the amount of collectibles
                 for the generated map (1 - 255)
  -e ENEMIES, --enemies ENEMIES
                 If present, this argument sets the amount of enemies
                 for the generated map (0 - 255)
  -s SEED, --seed SEED
                 If present, this argument sets the seed for the generated map.
                 Otherwise, a random seed will be used.
  -p PATH, --path PATH
                 If present, the generated map will be saved to a file at the
                 specified path. If the path is a directory, a .ber file with
                 the seed as the name will be created.
                 If not present, the map will be printed to STDOUT.
  -i INVALID_CODE, --invalid INVALID_CODE
                 If present, an invalid map will be generated.
                 Any combination of the following INVALID_CODEs
                 (separated by any symbol) can be chosen:
                    IE = invalid file extension
                    EF = empty file
                    EL = empty line
                    NR = not rectangular
                    NW = not completely surrounded by walls
                    NP = no path to all collectibles or exit
                    MP = missing player
                    ME = missing exit
                    MC = missing coins
                    EP = extra players
                    EE = extra exits
                    EC = extra/invalid character
